# Nostale_Bot
My small project that I found to be a good learning resource. 
If you want to save targeting, waypoints and loot options you should do exact same folders in your Nostale file.

This is the source code but if you are not interested in that and you want only bot you should be interested in that file.

Simply inject it into your game client by cheat engine or something else and then you will have everything you are looking for.
